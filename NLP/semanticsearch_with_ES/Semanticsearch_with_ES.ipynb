Our plant came online in 2002. In 2003, we built the world’s largest lactic acid manufacturing facility to feed our polymer plant. Then in 2009 we opened a state-of-the-art applications development facility. Most recently in 2016, we opened a new fermentation laboratory to develop commercial-scale methane to lactic acid fermentation technology.\\nToday, with representatives in over 10 countries, NatureWorks does business in North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific.
