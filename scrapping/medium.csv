Why Your Team Needs a Weekly Metrics Review,https://joulee.medium.com/why-your-team-needs-a-weekly-metrics-review-dcc9cce7ac3c?source=home---------4------------------0----------,"Julie ZhuoFollowNov 30·7 min readWhy Your Team Needs a Weekly Metrics ReviewAI generated prompt: epic team meeting that feels important and glorious in an oil painting style.A few weeks ago in our Manifesto for the Data Informed, one of the five beliefs presented was Company-wide familiarity with metrics rather than outsourcing to ‘data people.’Immediately, we were pummeled with questions: Does this really matter? Is this a realistic expectation? How can an organization achieve this? So for our next few posts, we’ll deep dive into how to make this lofty aspiration practical.As with anything else in life — whether people, languages or customs — there is no shortcut to gaining familiarity; the only way is through direct and frequent exposure.With data, most teams inherently understand this — that is why dashboards are built and links are passed around and we are all reminded to “please bookmark it and check it often.”Unfortunately, unless your job title includes the word data, the practice of loading said bookmark does not frequently arise to the top of your to-do list, even if you really truly do think data is important! Thus begins the great death spiral of dashboards — because they go unused, they become unmaintained. Because they are unmaintained, when you finally have a need to look at them, they’re broken and useless.This is why data-informed teams rely on practices other than sheer will to create data familiarity. The big three are 1. weekly metrics reviews, 2. weekly insight reports, and 3. insights reviews.In this installment, we’ll tackle one of the single most impactful practices of building a data-informed team: the weekly metrics review.What is a Weekly Metrics Review?A weekly metrics review is a synchronous team meeting to review the key metrics for a scaling, post-PMF product with all functional team members present — ie, PM, engineering, design, operations. This type of review can (and should!) happen at the executive level, with the CEO and C-level executives, and recurse down to individual product teams.A weekly metrics review should be short and sweet (think 5–15 minutes, typically at the start of a regular team meeting) and led by the data person who walks the group through the key metrics for your collective area of work (e.g. new user growth, revenue, conversion rates, tickets resolved).The group should examine how key metrics have progressed over the past few weeks, ideally by looking at a series of time-series line charts. The presenter can also prepare a few key segments to review, for example if a certain type of user, platform, or market is strategically important to the team, or if the team has launched something that impacts a particular segment (like a new feature in a test market).It’s best to keep the meeting lightweight. Preparation should be easy, ideally no more than 30 minutes. Many great metrics reviews simply start with screenshots of dashboards. The data person shouldn’t have to have all the answers at their finger tips (why did active users spike two weeks ago?). It’s fine to circle back with an answer later.What is a successful outcome for a weekly metrics review?Metrics reviews are unlike product reviews or decision meetings; the point is a shared understanding of how the team is progressing towards its goals, not making decisions or creating action items.This is an unusual proposition, especially when ambitious team are (rightfully!) wary of wasting time in meetings. After reading an article like this and trying out this style of meeting, you may find yourself wondering: Is this meeting actually helping us accomplish anything? It’s common for the weekly metrics review to get cancelled, demoted to an e-mail update, or become the spawning ground for long lists of follow-up questions just so the group feels they did something.And yet, we argue that familiarity with the impact of the team’s work is in of itself an important enough goal to create a synchronous cadence around. Because we work in a team environment, having shared context across different functions is critical. The ideal outcome of a metrics review is that each person develops a shared understanding of the following questions:1. How are we doing against our goals?Few things focus a group as effectively as seeing a chart of week-over-week progress inching towards a goal target. The ritual of doing this together forces the room to confront questions like Are we likely to hit our goal? and Is our recent work having the impact we expected?, which ultimately ladder to the Holy Grail question: Is our strategy working?2. Which levers are most important in reaching our goals?If it were obvious what a team should do, then success would be guaranteed. Alas, this is not how the world works.Creative teamwork is an infinite treadmill of trial and error — come up with ideas you hypothesize will lead to a desired outcome, then do the work to see if you’re right. When you take account of the results is when you learn to hone your skills.Take an example: let’s say we spent three months shipping Feature X. We might then have a decision to make, should we work on Xv2 next? Simply looking at X’s results in isolation isn’t enough to answer this question; we must consider this relative to other possibilities — what about improving features A, B or C? When we take the time to regularly reflect on the impact of our work through metric reviews, we build towards a richer knowledge of what really drives our business.Put another way, a major benefit of implementing weekly metrics reviews is that everyone on the team will improve their product thinking. For example, a designer will be less likely to propose an important button on the bottom of the page if he knows there’s roughly a 2x decrease in CTR compared to the top. An engineer will be more vigilant about holding the line on performance as she implements a new feature if she’s aware that snappy loading is a huge driver of usage.3. What is normal?Every business has some level of volatility and seasonality. For example, enterprise apps are more used during weekdays, while video games are played more on weekends. Say you expect Januarys to be worse than Decembers for your business, and as predicted, you see a January dip. How big would the dip have to be for you to be worried that something is wrong?Familiarity with the normal rhythms of your business is essential to quickly identifying when you might need to take action because something is amiss, or when there’s likely to be an error in your measurement. For example, if a team member reports that a recent experiment led to a 20% increase in Key Metric X, but you know X to be extremely difficult to move, you would be suspicious and probe further. Over time, a well-honed understanding of what is normal leads to better forecasting and future planning.Done well, the practice of weekly metric reviews creates a shared understanding of progress, hones a team’s strategic chops, and enables faster detection of issues.But beware one of the secret killers of metric reviews — too many follow-up questions.To be clear, asking questions is an important part of building familiarity, and good questions can lead to important new discoveries. However, not all questions are worth the effort it takes to answer them. It’s easy to rattle off a dozen questions just because you can and you’re a curious person, but you may unwittingly be creating hours of work in chasing follow-ups. Instead, aim to ask questions that are likely to lead to a change in decision.A good litmus test for whether a data question is worth asking is this: What is my estimate for the most optimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? Conversely, What is my estimate for the most pessimistic answer, and what will I do if that’s the real answer? If your actions for both questions are the same, you have a question that’s probably not worth answering.As an example, consider the question: What is our worst-performing country, and how much worse is it doing compared to an average country?If your pessimistic answer is Honestly I’m not going to do anything with this information unless it’s one of our Top 10 countries, then having someone spend a bunch of time querying for the result may not be worth it. (A better question might be: Which Top 10 country is performing the worst this quarter?)How can I start a Weekly Metrics Review?Practically speaking, starting the habit of metric reviews isn’t always easy, bacause you need convince other functions that it’s worth their time. If you are the data representative, start by discussing the idea with the person who has overall accountability for the team’s work and would be most interested in tracking progress and aligning towards a common goal. This could be the CEO, a general manager (ie head of operations, head of sales), or a product leader (ie PM, engineering lead, etc.)If you yourself are the directly accountable individual, then propose the idea of a metrics review with your data partner. If both of you agree, then ask the rest of the team to commit to trying it for at least a quarter. Tacking the practice to the start of a pre-existing team meeting also reduces friction.Your metrics review doesn’t have to be fully comprehensive to start. Consider beginning with a 10-minute slot every other week. The data representative should be prepared to direct the agenda and remind everyone of the goals in the early sessions (This is our main goal metric… I am showing you this segment because… I am showing you this related metric because…) Use the first few sessions to get feedback about the right set of metrics and cuts to look at. Remember: it’s better to start small and add over time than to overwhelm the group by flipping through dozens of charts and numbers. You can always follow up with a short e-mail summarizing what got discussed, with links for further exploration.What other practices help a team use data well?Stay tuned for the sequel: why your team should have insights report and insights reviews.Past posts in this series:Manifesto for the Data-InformedThe Blind Men, the Elephant, and the 3 Data MistakesGot other tips to share on running great metrics reviews?We want to hear your war stories and advice at datainformed@sundial.so.This article was written by Stanley Watt and Julie Zhuo.----19More from Julie ZhuoFollowBuilding Sundial.

Tyrion Lannister and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,https://medium.com/@elliotgraebert/tyrion-lannister-and-the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-ee572a276064?source=home---------5------------------0----------,"Elliot GraebertFollowDec 2·14 min readTyrion Lannister and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective PeopleA Game of Thrones-themed synopsis of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective PeopleStephen R. Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a staple amongst the productivity genre of self-help books. It was written over 30 years ago, yet it remains a best seller, often handed out at offsites or during company onboardings. The key to its success is not just the raw content, but the framework that Stephen uses to present the information:Habit 1: Be proactiveHabit 2: Begin with the end in mindHabit 3: Put first things firstHabit 4: Think win-winHabit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understoodHabit 6: SynergizeHabit 7: Sharpen the sawThe habits flow from one to the next. The first three are about taking responsibility and aligning your life to achieve your goals. The next three are about effectively working with other people. And the final habit is about the sustainability of your life in pursuit of those goals.While this framework is great, I read this book ten years ago, and I struggle to remember all seven habits.You know what I can remember? Vivid details from Game of Thrones, and I first read that book over 15 years ago. If you are the type of person that can remember half the episodes of The Office but struggle to remember a self-help book, then this post is for you.My intent with this post is to use Tyrion Lannister as a mnemonic device to help you to better remember the seven habits.If you haven’t read or watched Game of Thrones, I don’t recommend reading this post, as there are spoilers ahead. With that being said, here’s a brief reminder of who Tyrion is.Taken from Den of Geek, great backstory hereTyrion is the youngest son of the richest man in a war-torn land. As a dwarf, he is dismissed and disdained by a world that values physical prowess over mental acuity (which is Tyrion’s greatest strength). Tyrion is a well-written, flawed character whose proclivity for drink and biting wit made him a fan favorite among the Game of Thrones audience. As an imperfect character, he has many ineffective moments in which not employing the seven habits drives him to ruin. However, in his best moments, there are many parallels between what he does and what Stephen Covey is trying to express.If you like this post, please 👏 , subscribe, or follow me on medium or LinkedIn to let me know I’m on the right track!Habit 1: Be proactive — Tyrion, Mord, and the Sky Cells“Habit 1 is about taking responsibility for your life. Proactive people recognize that they are ‘response-able.’ They don’t blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behaviour. They know they can choose their behaviour. Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find external sources to blame for their behaviour. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and performance, and they blame the weather.”Taken from the Game of Thrones wikiBeing proactive is the foundation upon which the other habits rely. The dictionary definition of being proactive is taking action to control your future, but Stephen Covey uses it to mean that you are responsible for your actions and not a victim of other people’s actions. He’s not focused on your ability to control the outcome but rather on your ability to control yourself. Reactive people think in the opposite way, always blaming their circumstances or others for their poor behavior.Let’s look at some cases in which Tyrion was both proactive and reactive.Early on in the books, Tyrion was captured and thrown into the sky cells in the Eyrie. Tyrion could have sat and waited for his brother to come rescue him (which multiple people suggested), but instead, he chose to proactively secure his own freedom. Even when his jailor, Mord, beat him, he refused to let Mord control his response. In the TV series, viewers watch as Tyrion works hard to maintain his composure and stay in control of his responses.Have you ever witnessed a situation at work where one person gets frustrated and raises their voice, and then someone else matches their tone, and the situation escalates? Eventually, things devolve, and no one walks away happy. Imagine how different it would be if they had acted like Tyrion with Mord. Throughout my career, I’ve often coached people on finding the “reasonable response to an unreasonable situation.” This is Tyrion in a nutshell.Now, Tyrion doesn’t always act this way — it was not acting this way that led to his initial downfall. In particular, Tyrion’s family was able to elicit a reactive (non-proactive) response. Joffrey (his nephew) could easily provoke a reaction out of Tyrion. Those reactions led to his being jailed and sentenced to death. It is difficult to remain in control with people you have a history with, which is why family get-togethers can be so stressful. This is probably why Vars and Littlefinger were so much more effective than Tyrion, when it came to Joffrey.When trying to avoid reactive behavior, picture Tyrion reacting to Joffrey. It ruined his life, and reactive behavior can ruin yours. Don’t allow someone else’s actions to control your behavior.When thinking of proactive behavior, picture Tyrion escaping the Sky Cells. When presented with a difficult situation, take control and create the future you want — ideally, one where you survive to fight another day.Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind — defending King’s Landing“Habit 2 is the ability to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes. It is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There is a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation. The physical creation follows the mental, just as a building follows a blueprint.”Taken from Season 2, Episode 8 of Game of ThronesStephen Covey’s habits all build upon one another. Proactive people have the drive to seek improvement, and the second habit (begin with the end in mind) ensures that one’s energy is focused on a goal. Without a goal, you are likely to be aimless and unsuccessful. While this sounds straightforward, many people do not start with an end goal in mind, and their hard work never creates the future they want. Once you’ve set an end goal, the next steps are to create a plan (mental creation) and then execute it (physical creation).For the second habit, the best metaphor is the defense of King’s Landing, also known as the battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion proactively took it upon himself to lead the defense of the city (despite constant hindrances from Joffrey and Cersei). Let’s view this from the angle of the second habit:Tyrion’s Goal: Don’t die. This was a simple goal, but very motivational. If the professional world had the same stakes, I think we’d find it much easier to create alignment across teams. Hmm…Tyrion’s Plan: Find a way to defend against vastly superior numbers. Once Tyrion set his goal, he needed a plan that negated Stannis’ superior numbers. Tyrion poured over maps, debated with Varys, and conspired with the pyromancers. He determined where Stannis would attack and how he would compete against superior forces: setting the river on fire (the wildfire explosion).Execution: Don your armor. Finally, the reader’s favorite part — the battle itself.The second habit is not complicated. Being proactive without a goal isn’t going to win the war. Having a goal but no plan won’t help you overcome your enemies. And having a plan that you can’t execute is likely a sign of insanity. To apply the second habit in your life, picture Tyrion trying to stay alive (the goal), pouring over maps (the plan), and fighting on the beach (the execution). Find your King’s Landing and defend it.Habit 3: Put first things first — Tyrion and Pycelle“Habit 3 is the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. Habit 3 is the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2. Habit 1 says, ‘You are the creator. You are in charge.’ Habit 2 is the first mental creation, based on imagination, the ability to envision what you can become. Habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation.”Taken from Season 2, Episode 3 of Game of ThronesProactive people (habit 1) start by choosing a goal (habit 2), and habit 3 is about taking your first steps. I’ve worked with leads who were proactive and knew their goals but poorly prioritized their time — exactly like Ned Stark. He swept into King’s Landing and immediately began making waves. He didn’t prioritize cultivating a solid base and, in the end, was betrayed by the city guard, the small council, and the King. He tried to take a shortcut, and his neck was cut short as a result.In the early books, Tyrion is wavers between being both effective and ineffective. There were two key moments when he became Hand of the King in which he demonstrated he was a keen believer in the fourth habit of putting first things first.(1) Tyrion replaced the commander of the city guard.Tyrion knew that Ned (the former hand of the King) had been betrayed by the commander of the city guard. This betrayal came at a crucial moment and was primarily the reason Ned died. Ned entirely skipped gaining the allegiance of the city guard and assumed that they would follow him because of their morals. While Ned was exceptionally proactive (habit 1), he entirely failed at habits 2 and 3: having a plan and executing it in the correct order.Tyrion was much more thoughtful, and he replaced the commander with Bronn, his (mostly) loyal mercenary companion. The theatrics of the event were great because the audience had no reason to expect this outcome (as the commander had not done anything against Tyrion). Tyrion was proactively fixing the most important problems first.(2) Tyrion identified loyalties amongst the small council.Tyrion planted information about a “secret plan” with three other members of the small council. The rumor was something that his arch-rival (Cersei) would be interested in, but each of the three had a slightly different version of the same rumor. When Cersei confronted him about the rumor, Tyrion immediately knew which council member was the source of the leak. I absolutely loved watching this play out — it was brilliant writing. It was also a perfect example of putting first things first.This was probably the most brilliant maneuver Tyrion ever made, and he followed it up with a blunder that nearly ruined him. Tyrion’s emotions got the better of him (thanks to his toxic family), and he failed to utilize habit 2. Tyrion reacted by throwing Pycelle in prison instead of using him as a known spy. Knowing that Pycelle was the leak, Tyrion could have fed him information to mislead Cersei. He wasn’t thinking about his end goals in this case but rather letting himself be reactive.Mental image: Be like Tyrion with the commander of the city guard and the small council. Do first things first, lest you get beheaded like Ned.Habit 4: Think win-win — Tyrion and Shagga“Habit 4 is about seeing life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive one. Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. We both get to eat the pie, and it tastes pretty darn good!”Taken from the Game of Thrones wikiA win-win situation is one in which you seek out solutions that allow both parties to get ahead. People often view situations as a zero-sum game: one party wins, and one party loses. Stephen Covey disagrees with this mindset and instead challenges you to do better.What better example is there of a win-win situation than when Tyrion convinces the hill tribes to fight for him? Tyrion had just escaped from the Eyrie, accompanied by Bronn. The Hill Tribes ambushed them (led by Shagga), yet Tyrion turned the tables. He didn’t just bribe them to let him live; he also convinced them to join him as his personal vanguard. The tribesman got the weapons and plunder they wanted, and Tyrion got his own mini-army.The best example of a win-win I’ve seen in a professional environment was between a product team and my team (the platform team). The product team wanted more features, but my team didn’t have the bandwidth. Instead of fighting, the product team reprioritized its recruiting to hire more platform team members. At the time, this blew my mind. I was fully prepared for a fight, but instead, I got a larger team, and the platform team got its features.Mental image: When in a conflict at work, picture Tyrion and Shagga and think, “how can I create a win-win situation?”Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood — Tyrion and the Night’s Watch“Habit 5 is about how most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. You listen to yourself as you prepare in your mind what you are going to say, the questions you are going to ask, etc. You filter everything you hear through your life experiences, your frame of reference. You check what you hear against your autobiography and see how it measures up. Consequently, you decide prematurely what the other person means before they finish communicating.”Taken from Season 1, Episode 3 of Game of ThronesOne of the things that made Tyrion so formidable (even given his stature) was his willingness to seek understanding. When I think “seek first to understand,” I visualize Tyrion heading north to the wall in the very beginning of the books/show. He wanted to see for himself what the Night’s Watch was all about. He spent time talking to Mormont, Aemon, Benjen, and Jon Snow, all in his quest for understanding. He didn’t try and push an agenda on them or make changes; he was simply there to understand.He used his experience with Mormont to establish trust with his son, Jorah Mormant. Later, he used his experience with Jon Snow to provide advice to Daenerys. My point is that Tyrion sought knowledge and understanding first, and it paid off down the road.I strongly agree with Stephen Covey’s fifth habit, and I think it is the most important. People constantly fail to seek understanding, and in debates, they are just waiting for their chance to speak. I’m absolutely guilty of this. In my experience, the vast majority of conflicts could have been avoided if both parties sought understanding instead of trying to push their own agendas.When you are in a tough situation at work, ask yourself: have you walked the wall like Tyrion, or are you at home in King’s Landing casting judgment from afar?Habit 6: Synergize — Tyrion and Bronn“Habit 6 is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn’t happen on its own. It’s a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table.”Taken from the Game of Thrones wikiIn a synergy, you aren’t looking for someone who is the polar opposite of you but rather someone who complements your weaknesses while also adding to your most critical strengths. Throughout the books, George R. Martin repeatedly wove characters together and demonstrated the power of synergy. Examples of these synergistic pairs includeJamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarth,Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth,Hodor and Bran Stark,Jon Snow and Tormund,Arya Stark and The Hound, andTyrion and Bronn.Let’s focus on Tyrion and Bronn, as they are an example of a synergy that Tyrion created in order to advance his career aspirations. Tyrion was well-read, smart, and quick with politics, money, and strategy. However, his physical stature made him a liability in combat. His synergistic pairing was with Bronn. Bronn was a ruthless warrior, far more interested in winning than in being honorable (which suited Tyrion just fine). With Bronn at his back, Tyrion was able to brazenly walk into risky situations that otherwise would have proven fatal for him.In a professional setting, it’s easy to hire people who have the same skills as you instead of hiring against your weaknesses. I think this is because humans have a tendency to artificially inflate other people’s worth if they share our traits or values. However, when building a team, you need to think about your strengths and weaknesses, especially as they relate to problems you are facing.Mental image: Do you have a Bronn who balances out your shortcomings?Habit 7: Sharpen the saw — Tyrion and Shai“Habit 7 is about preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have: you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual.”Taken from IGNWhat restorative activities did Tyrion seek outside his role that made him effective?If you hadn’t guessed already, the obvious metaphor for habit 7 would be Shae and Tyrion’s relationship. Tyrion fought most of his battles with his mind (mental), meaning that his restoration needed to be in the physical and emotional arenas. Without going into details, let’s just say that Shae was what Tyrion needed to balance out the rest of his life.The point is that everyone needs a counterbalance in their life that enables them to bring their best self to work. Early in my career, I was a workaholic, and I threw more and more hours into my job. Because so much of my mental stability was wrapped up in my work, conflicts at work would eat away at me. I struggled to maintain the other six habits in my daily behavior because I was mentally drained at all times.My advice for everyone, regardless of where you are in your career, is this: find something outside of work that you can become truly passionate about. It could be a partner, a pet, competitive drag racing — anything that is not your job. You will find it infinitely easier to let go of things at work and remain cool and collected in the face of unreasonable situations.Mental image: Find your Shae.Wrap-upBoth the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Game of Thrones are classic books for a reason. Stephen Covey’s book imparts wisdom, and George R. R. Martin’s book is highly memorable. The combination of the two would be a memorable book of wisdom.This blog post is basically the spark-notes for that book:Be proactive: Don’t be like Tyrion with Joffrey, allowing others to control your actions.Begin with the end in mind: What is the “King’s Landing” in your work life that you need to defend?Put first things first: Be like Tyrion with the small council, rooting out the traitors before they could betray him.Win-win: Stop thinking of situations as win-lose — get Shagga to work for you.Seek first to understand: Walk the “wall” before making decisions.Synergize: Compliment your weaknesses with a Bronn.Sharpen the saw: What is your Shae? How do you rejuvenate your mind and your body?If you enjoyed reading this post, let me know. If there’s a popular book that you think could make a better metaphor, drop it in the comments!----31More from Elliot GraebertFollowFormer Head of Internal Cloud at Palantir, Infrastructure and Security Nerd, Gamer, DadLove podcasts or audiobooks?

What if failure is the plan?,https://zephoria.medium.com/what-if-failure-is-the-plan-2f219ea1cd62?source=home---------6------------------0----------,"danah boydFollowDec 5·14 min readWhat if failure is the plan?I’ve been thinking a lot about failure lately. Failure comes in many forms, but I’m especially interested in situations in which people *perceive* something as failing (or about to fail) and the contestations over failure that often arise in such situations. Given this, it’s hard not to be fascinated by all that’s unfolding around Twitter. At this point in the story of Musk’s takeover, there’s a spectrum of perspectives about Twitter’s pending doom (or lack thereof). But there’s more to failure than the binary question of “will Twitter fail or won’t it?” Here’s some thoughts on how I’m thinking about the failure question…8633780 © Andrey Kiselev1. Failure of social media sites tends to be slow then fast.I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the aughts trying to understand the rise and fall of social network sites like Friendster and MySpace. I noticed something fascinating. If a central node in a network disappeared and went somewhere else (like from MySpace to Facebook), that person could pull some portion of their connections with them to a new site. However, if the accounts on the site that drew emotional intensity stopped doing so, people stopped engaging as much. Watching Friendster come undone, I started to think that the fading of emotionally sticky nodes was even more problematic than the disappearance of segments of the graph.With MySpace, I was trying to identify the point where I thought the site was going to unravel. When I started seeing the disappearance of emotionally sticky nodes, I reached out to members of the MySpace team to share my concerns and they told me that their numbers looked fine. Active uniques were high, the amount of time people spent on the site was continuing to grow, and new accounts were being created at a rate faster than accounts were being closed. I shook my head; I didn’t think that was enough. A few months later, the site started to unravel.Flickr: Carla Lynn HallOn a different project, I was talking with a cis/hetero dating site that was struggling with fraud. Many of its “fake” accounts were purportedly “women” but they were really a scam to entice people into paying for a porn site. But when the site started removing these profiles, they found that the site as a whole was unraveling. Men didn’t like these fake women, but their profiles enticed them to return. Moreover, attractive women saw these profiles and felt like it was a site full of people more attractive than them so they came. When the fake women disappeared, the real women disappeared. And so did the men.Network effects intersect with perception to drive a sense of a site’s social relevance and interpersonal significance.I don’t have access to the Twitter social graph these days, but I’d bet my bottom dollar that it would indicate whether or not the site was on a trajectory towards collapse. We are certainly seeing entire sub-networks flock to Mastodon, but that’s not as meaningful as people might think because of the scale and complexity of the network graph. You can lose whole segments and not lose a site. However, if those departing are creating Swiss cheese into the network graph, then I would worry.The bigger question concerns those emotionally sticky nodes. What constitutes a “can’t be missed” account or post varies. What draws someone to a service like Twitter varies. For some, it is the libidinal joy of seeing friends and community, the posts that provide light touch pleasure and joy. For others, it’s a masochistic desire for seeing content that raises one’s blood pressure. Still others can’t resist the drama of a train wreck.The funny thing about Twitter’s feed algorithms is that they were designed to amplify the content that triggered the most reaction, those emotionally sticky posts. This is why boring but informative content never has a chance against that which prompts fury. But it also means that we’re all watching how our little universe of content is changing (or not). Are you still seeing the things that give you pleasure? Or just the stuff that makes you angry? Why can’t you resist looking away from the things that give you pain? (That question isn’t a new one… it’s the question that underlies our toxic social media ecology more generally.)I have to give Musk and gang some credit for knowing that drama brings traffic. The drama that unfolds in the World Cup is wholesome compared to the drama of watching public acts of humiliation, cruelty, and hate. We’re in a modern day Coliseum watching a theater of suffering performed for the king under the rubric of “justice.” And just like the ancient Romans, we can’t look away.But how long can the spectacle last? Even the Roman Empire eventually collapsed, but perhaps the theater of the absurd can persist for a while. Still, there are other factors to consider.2. Failure can be nothing more than a normal accident that tears down the infrastructure.Nearly everyone I talk with is surprised that the actual service of Twitter is mostly still working. What that says to me is that the engineering team was far more solid than I appreciated. Any engineering team worth its salt is going to build redundancy and resilience into the system. Exceptions that are thrown should be caught and managed. But that doesn’t mean that a system can persist indefinitely without maintenance and repair.Think of it in terms of a house. If you walk away from your home for a while, the pipes will probably keep working fine on their own. Until a big freeze comes. And then, if no one is looking, they’ll burst, flood the house, and trigger failure after failure. The reason for doing maintenance is to minimize the likelihood of this event. And the reason to have contingencies built in is to prevent a problem from rippling across the system.What happens when Twitter’s code needs to be tweaked to manage an iOS upgrade? Or if a library dependency goes poof? What happens when a security vulnerability isn’t patched?One interesting concept in organizational sociology is “normal accidents theory.” Studying Three Mile Island, Charles Perrow created a 2x2 grid before b-schools everywhere made this passé.One axis represented the complexity of interactions in a system; the other axis reflected the “coupling” of a system. A loosely coupled system has little dependencies, but a tightly coupled system has components that are highly dependent on others. Perrow argued that “normal accidents” were nearly inevitable in a complex, tightly coupled system. To resist such an outcome, systems designers needed to have backups and redundancy, safety checks and maintenance. In the language of computers, resilience requires having available “buffer” to manage any overflow.Having dozens of engineers working around the clock to respond to crises can temporarily prevent failure. But those engineers will get tired, mistakes will happen, and maintenance will get kicked down the road. Teams need buffer as much as systems do.I’m concerned about the state of the team at Twitter, not just because so many people were laid off. If my hunch is right, many of the engineers who are keeping Twitter going fall into four groups. There are immigrants on H1Bs who are effectively indentured servants, many of whom would leave if they could, but the industry is falling apart which makes departures unlikely. There are also apolitical engineers who need a job and there are few jobs to be found in the industry right now. Neither of these groups will want to drive themselves to the bone in the long term. Then there are Musk fanboys who want to ride this rollercoaster for whatever personal motivation. And there are goons on loan from other public companies that Musk owns. (Side note: how how how is it legal for Musk to use employees from public companies for his private project!?!? Is this something that the Delaware courts are going to influence?)Fail Whale, an internet iconIn the early days of Twitter, moments of failure were celebrated with a Fail Whale, the iconic image that Twitter posted when something went terribly awry in the system, requiring it to be shut down and, effectively, rebooted. It’s been a long time since we saw the Fail Whale because there was a strong infrastructure team who worked to bake resilience into the system. In other words, Twitter grew up.How long can the resilience of the system allow it to keep functioning? It could be quite a while. But I also can’t help but think of a video I saw years ago about what would happen to New York City if the humans suddenly disappeared overnight. First the pipes burst and the rats invaded. But without humans leaving behind trash, the rats eventually died. The critters that remained? The cockroaches of course.3. Failure is entangled with perception.If you searched for “miserable failure” (or even just “failure”) on September 29, 2006, the first result was the official George W. Bush biography. This act of “Google bombing” made the internet lol. But it also hinted at a broader dynamic related to failure. There are failures that everyone can agree are failures (e.g. the explosion of the Challenger), but most failures are a matter of perception.Politicians, policies, companies, and products are often deemed a “failure” rhetorically by those who oppose them, regardless of any empirical measure one might use. George W. Bush was deemed a failure by those who were opposed to his “War on Terrorism.” Declaring something a failure is a way to delegitimize it. And when something is delegitimized, it can become a failure.Photo 182315403 © mariavonotnaI often think back to MySpace’s downfall. In 2007, I penned a controversial blog post noting a division that was forming as teenagers self-segregated based on race and class in the US, splitting themselves between Facebook and MySpace. A few years later, I noted the role of the news media in this division, highlighting how media coverage about MySpace as scary, dangerous, and full of pedophiles (regardless of empirical evidence) helped make this division possible. The news media played a role in delegitimizing MySpace (aided and abetted by a team at Facebook, which was directly benefiting from this delegitimization work).Perception (including racism and classism) have shaped the social media landscape since the beginning.A lot has changed about our news media ecosystem since 2007. In the United States, it’s hard to overstate how the media is entangled with contemporary partisan politics and ideology. This means that information tends not to flow across partisan divides in coherent ways that enable debate. In general, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the left declare conservative politicians/policies to be failures, this has little impact on the right because it is actively ignored by the media outlets consumed by those on the right. But interestingly, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the right declare progressive politicians/policies to be failures, both mainstream media and the left obsessively amplify falsehoods and offensive content in an attempt to critique and counteract them. (Has anyone on the left managed to avoid hearing about the latest round of celebrity anti-Semitism?)I’m especially fascinated by how the things that are widely deemed failures are deemed failures for different reasons across the political spectrum. Consider the withdrawal in Afghanistan. The right did a fantastic job of rhetorically spinning this as a Biden failure, while the left criticized aspects of the mission. This shared perception of failure landed in the collective public consciousness; there was no need to debate why individual groups saw it as failure. Of course, this also meant that there was no shared understanding of what led to that point, no discussion of what should’ve been done other than it should’ve been done better. Perceptions of failure don’t always lead to shared ideas of how to learn from these lessons.The partisan and geopolitical dimensions of perception related to Twitter are gobsmacking. Twitter has long struggled to curb hate, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, and harassment. For a long time, those on the right have labeled these efforts censorship. Under the false flag of freedom of speech, the new Twitter has eradicated most safeguards, welcoming in a new era of amplified horrors, with the news media happily covering this spectacle. (This is what led Joan Donovan and I to talk about the importance of strategic silence.)Musk appears to be betting that the spectacle is worth it. He’s probably correct in thinking that large swaths of the world will not deem his leadership a failure either because they are ideologically aligned with him or they simply don’t care and aren’t seeing any changes to their corner of the Twitterverse.He also appears to believe that the advertising community will eventually relent because they always seem to do so when an audience is lingering around. And with a self-fashioned Gladiator torturing his enemies for sport in front of a live audience, there are lots of dollars on the table. Musk appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out.So the big question in my mind is: how effective will the perception that Twitter is failing be in the long run, given how it is not jumping across existing ideological divisions? Perception of failure can bring about failure, but it doesn’t always. That’s the story of many brands who resist public attacks. Perception of failure can also just fade into the background, reifying existing divisions.Of course, a company needs money and the only revenue stream Twitter has stems from advertising. This is one of the reasons that activism around the advertisers matters. If advocates can convince advertisers to hold out, that will starve a precarious system. That is a tangible way to leverage perception of failure. Same can be said if advocates manage to convince Apple or Google to de-list. Or if perception can be leveraged into court fights, Congressional battles, or broader policy sanctions. But right now, it seems as though perception has gotten caught in the left/right cultural war that is unfolding in the United States.4. Failure is an end state.There are many ways in which the Twitter story could end, but it’s important to remember that most companies do eventually end (or become unrecognizable after 100+ years). The internet is littered with failed companies. And even though companies like Yahoo! still have a website, they are in a “permanently failing” status. Most companies fail when they run out of money. And the financials around Twitter are absurd. As a company, it has persisted almost entirely on a single profit stream: advertising. That business strategy requires eyeballs. As we’ve already witnessed, a subscription plan for salvation is a joke.The debt financing around Twitter is gob-smacking. I cannot for the life of me understand what the creditors were thinking, but the game of finance is a next level sport where destroying people, companies, and products to achieve victory is widely tolerated. Historical trends suggest that the losers in this chaos will not be Musk or the banks, but the public.For an anchor point, consider the collapse of local news journalism. The myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn’t give a shit about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of town. So financiers squeezed the news orgs until there was no money to be squeezed and then they hung them out to dry. There was no configuration in which local news was going to survive, no magical upwards trajectory of revenue based on advertising alone. If it weren’t for craigslist and Google, the financiers would’ve squeezed these enterprises for a few more years, but the end state was always failure. Failure was the profit strategy for the financiers. (It still boggles my mind how many people believe that the loss of news journalism is because of internet advertising. I have to give financiers credit for their tremendous skill at shifting the blame.)Photo 55254243 © Romolo TavaniI highly doubt that Twitter is going to be a 100-year company. For better or worse, I think failure is the end state for Twitter. The question is not if but when, how, and who will be hurt in the process?Right now, what worries me are the people getting hurt. I’m sickened to watch “journalists” aid and abet efforts to publicly shame former workers (especially junior employees) in a sadistic game of “accountability” that truly perverts the concept. I’m terrified for the activists and vulnerable people around the world whose content exists in Twitter’s databases, whose private tweets and DMs can be used against them if they land in the wrong hands (either by direct action or hacked activity). I’m disgusted to think that this data will almost certainly be auctioned off.Frankly, there’s a part of me that keeps wondering if there’s a way to end this circus faster to prevent even greater harms. (Dear Delaware courts, any advice?)No one who creates a product wants to envision failure as an inevitable end state. Then again, humans aren’t so good at remembering that death is an inevitable end state either. But when someone doesn’t estate plan, their dependents are left with a mess. Too many of us have watched the devastating effects of dementia and, still, few of us plan for all that can go wrong when our minds fall apart and we lash out at the ones we love. Few companies die a graceful death either. And sadly, that’s what I expect we’re about to see. A manic, demented creature hurting everyone who loved it on its way out the door.Closing ThoughtsI’m not omniscient. I don’t know where this story ends. But after spending the last few years obsessing over what constitutes failure, I can’t help but watch this situation with a rock in my stomach.Failure isn’t a state, but a process. It can be a generative process. After all, some plants only grow after a forest fire. (And yes, yes, tech is currently obsessed with “fail fast.” But frankly, that’s more about a status game than actually learning.)Failure should not always be the end goal. There’s much to be said about the journey, about living a worthy life, about growing and learning and being whole. Yet, what keeps institutions, systems, companies, and products whole stems from how they are configured within a network of people, practices, and perception. Radical shifts in norms, values, and commitments can rearrange how these networks are configured. This is why transitions are hard and require a well-thought through strategy to prevent failure, especially if the goal is to be whole ethically.Watching this situation unfold, a little voice keeps nagging in my head. How should our interpretation of this situation shift if we come to believe that failure is the desired end goal? There’s a big difference between a natural forest fire and one that stems from the toxic mixture of arson and climate change.----23More from danah boydFollowresearcher of technology & society | Microsoft Research, Data & Society, NYU | zephoria@zephoria.orgLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Why are there so many Web3 startups?,https://efeng.medium.com/why-are-there-so-many-web3-startups-43a150379d52?source=home---------7------------------0----------,"Eric FengFollowDec 4·6 min readWhy are there so many Web3 startups?This week, Pitchbook published their latest Emerging Tech Indicator (ETI) report which tracks early stage investment activity amongst the world’s most successful venture capital firms to “gauge which areas of tech are grabbing VCs’ attention”. In Q3, the sector that received the largest amount of VC dollars according to the ETI report was Web3 with nearly $900 million. That’s more than fintech, biotech, security, ecommerce, gaming, and dozens of other mainstream industries.ETI funding by sector in Q3 2022And Q3 wasn’t the first time that Web3 topped the ETI report. In fact, Web3 has led the ETI rankings for 5 consecutive quarters now. Over the past 12 months, there has been over $6.5 billion of ETI capital invested into Web3, which is more than double that of the next highest category of fintech at $2.7 billion.ETI funding by sector over the past 12 monthsEven with all the ongoing challenges across cryptocurrency, which has seen its combined market capitalization decline by 2/3 since last November, investment interest in the sector remains stronger than other industries. Why? Because entrepreneurs still want to start Web3 companies.What is Web3?Building a good Web3 startup is hard. Explaining what makes a startup Web3 in the first place is even harder. Here are a few attempts. Leading Web3 investor A16Z describes Web3 as “the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens”. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3, describes it as “an alternative vision of the web, where the services that we use are purely algorithmic things hosted by everybody”. Web3 has also been called “the hyperfinancialization of all human existence” and where “every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity”. Pretty confusing right?Google Trends on searches for “Web3”Here’s a simpler definition: a Web3 startup interacts with data stored on a blockchain. That’s it. Read from Ethereum via an RPC provider? You’re a Web3 company. Send a transaction on the Solana network? Web3. Implement a Connect Wallet button on your website? Same. Blockchains, the public shared ledgers of information, are the data building blocks of Web3, and if you use any of this data in your product, then you’re part of Web3 too.Now why is this interesting to entrepreneurs? Because we haven’t had free access to data in a long time.The Web3 data equalizerAll consumer products need data. If you’re building a restaurant discovery website, you need reviews. If you’re building a shopping app, you need a product catalog. If you’re building a photo or music or video sharing service, you need (obviously) photos or music or videos. Sure you can get users to create that data for you — after all, users authoring data is the core tenet of Web2. But it takes a lot of users to create a useful amount of data, and until then the product experience for those few initial users will be incomplete or simply bad, which is then an impediment to acquiring more users. So you’re stuck in not a vicious cycle, but a stagnant cycle.For entrepreneurs from a decade plus ago, data used to be readily available online. You could crawl it (ex. Airbnb crawling apartment listings from Craigslist), or subscribe to it via RSS feeds that publishers were widely distributing. Platforms like Facebook and Google were also generous with their data providing robust API access (remember all the social games that used Facebook’s Graph API?). There was once even an entire category of products called mashups predicated around this idea of shared data that was composable.Housingmaps.com in 2005, considered one of the first Web2 mashupsUnfortunately for entrepreneurs today, data is no longer easily accessible. RSS has been largely abandoned, most sites prohibit crawling and will sue to prevent it, and platform APIs from Facebook and others have either been shut down entirely or severely limited. More than ever, the web is a collection of walled data gardens controlled by a handful of gatekeepers and for good reason: the data and the infrastructure running that data is incredibly valuable. Gartner last year reported that 80% of the global cloud infrastructure market is controlled by just 5 companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei. It’s no coincidence that these are 5 of the most valuable technology companies in the world.The “haves” (companies with data) generally no longer want to share with the “have nots” (startups), which is why Web3 has become so attractive to entrepreneurs: you get to build with data in Web3. With blockchains, data is freely available to everyone. There are no gatekeepers to blockchain data because ownership is decentralized across tens of thousands of individuals or entities running their own shared copies of the data. You can spin up your own Ethereum node in a matter of minutes and download the entire blockchain onto about 1TB of storage. That would fit on many laptops so there’s not a lot of expensive infrastructure you need either.Because of blockchain ledgers, data access in Web3 is equal. Every startup has access to the same tokens, wallet addresses, transaction history, etc. and can build as complete a customer experience as any other company. We’re all “haves” in Web3, but is what we have useful? In other words, Web3 startups can now build new products that are filled from day one with all of this public blockchain data. But does this public blockchain data help make products that customers actually want to use?What lies beyond financial speculation?There has been one dominant customer value proposition for all Web3 startups this year. One powerful use case that all of their Web3 products — from games to art to fitness tracking — have been helping customers with: making money. During the last crypto bull market, every Web3 product became a speculative asset, and making money became the only scenario Web3 companies had to think about. When your product promises to generate positive returns for customers, it doesn’t have to promise much else.Take for example NFTs, which rocketed in popularity this year with millions of people owning them. In the bull market, NFT startups focused all their energy on helping those million users make money because the primary use case for NFTs was financial speculation. In their pursuit of driving up the price, most NFT product innovation centered around building reward systems for holding onto NFTs (i.e. staking) as well as creating walled gardens around NFT ownership (i.e. token gated content). But those features came at the expense of investments into arguably more interesting product explorations like being able to do things with NFTs and have them interact with other projects.Remember, NFTs are stored on blockchains where the data is freely accessible by anyone. Therefore, Web3 entrepreneurs should be building all sorts of novel, interoperable experiences with NFTs, just like Web2 entrepreneurs did with mashups. But because everyone was so obsessed with just the floor price, NFT projects built entire products designed to keep people from doing anything with their NFTs or having them interact with any other project. The pursuit of financial speculation above all else took data that was inherently open and made it closed.But now we’re in a downmarket where returns are negative. Web3 products can no longer rely on just the use case of making people money, and have to provide other value to earn the time and patronage of customers. We’re going to see a lot of entrepreneurial time and energy shift from innovating on financial speculation to pursuing new ideas for what you can do with data stored on shared ledgers besides making money. Will customers find these new scenarios valuable? Will products filled with public blockchain data be useful?Who knows for sure. But because entrepreneurs still want to build Web3 startups and investors want to fund these companies, we’re about to find out.----33More from Eric FengFollowCurrent: Co-founder of @cymbalxyz, Co-founder of @GoldHouseCo Ventures.

What Marriage Means to Me,https://chasten.medium.com/what-marriage-means-to-me-a6bdd72cffe1?source=home---------8------------------0----------,"Chasten ButtigiegFollowNov 29·3 min readWhat Marriage Means to MeAfter dropping the kids off, I came home and stopped in the kitchen to take in the aftermath of our chaotic morning together. And it got me thinking.There were the bibs I should have tossed in the sink that were leaking milk onto the counter. Their little toothbrushes they used to scrub the teeth that have been keeping them up at night. Tiny hairbands from Penelope’s quick updo in which she kept repeating the word “bosh” while I brushed her hair as she wiggled her head out of my grasp with each stroke. The stacked plates, empty and crusty after a hurried but hilarious breakfast full of giggles ad music. The twins and I bounced along to the Christmas music as they ate their bananas and eggs while I prayed for the coffee maker to go faster. Pete used to protest Christmas music in the morning, now he encourages it. Parenting changes us, doesn’t it?He danced around me and fed the dogs while singing along, getting the kids to smile and giggle with his silly faces and voices — while doing his best not to get anything on his suit pants before rushing out the door and off to the to the airport. I didn’t remember where he was headed, but I knew it was important.This is what marriage is to me.Mornings spent negotiating the daily schedule while stuffing diaper bags. It’s the sweat-inducing challenge of getting a sweater on a wiggling toddler and the smile that comes from how cute they are once you succeed. It’s scattered building blocks on the floor and scrambled eggs on the wall. It’s goodbye kisses at the door and thermoses of coffee in the minivan. It’s having the right to juggle it all with the person who makes you feel loved and supported amidst the chaos.It’s the right to have a shoulder to lean on at end of the day in the first place.It’s the promise of hard work for your partner, your kids, and for us, our country.My marriage has filled this house with so much love it makes me want to be a better husband, father, and citizen every day. It’s called me to something bigger than myself while recognizing that my kids are now the most important thing in life, and I’d do anything to protect them. Our family and our union push me to make sure we leave our kids a country and a world they can thrive in so that they, too, can enjoy all of the love and light and happiness that Pete and I have known simply by falling in love with one another.I know how precious this union is and how sacred and fragile our unions can be in the eyes of our ever-changing democracy. We are not yet afforded the pleasure of letting our shoulders down, of taking a breath. We are fully aware that some desperately want to take this away. I hope that we can move on from these votes, these arguments, and these debates soon.The Senate is poised to vote on the #RespectForMarriageAct today. I hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle will listen to over 70% of Americans and vote to protect families like mine and the unions that make us all better Americans.And if a member of congress is confused, or has questions and wants to turn down the noise from the online rhetoric — our playroom is always open, should you want to meet a family who is just trying their best to make their kids happy and their country better, just like you.----89More from Chasten ButtigiegFollowHusband, father, teacher, advocate, and bestselling author of ""I Have Something to Tell You."".Love podcasts or audiobooks?

Leaving San Francisco,https://nmoryl.com/leaving-san-francisco-2bf3663072cd?source=home---------9------------------0----------,"Open in appSign upSign InWriteSign upSign InNicholas MorylFollowNov 23·8 min readSaveLeaving San FranciscoWhen I first landed in the Bay Area my taxi driver got lost.It was July 2011. I had just stepped off a 13-hour flight from London, where I had spent the past 2 years. (Technically the flight was from Stockholm where I had been visiting friends for a long weekend, but regardless — )I wasn’t going far — just to Menlo Park, where I was to be staying on a friend’s sofa — but this was before you could assume everyone had a magic box in their pocket that could solve more or less any problem in a few taps. 6 weeks before, when I had been staying with the same friend while interviewing for a new job, I had to get a GPS with my rental car to find my way around. It was a strange, liminal time. Everyone could feel that the world had fundamentally changed but the oncoming wave of mobile technology was still primitive and limited, an often frustrating glimmer of its full potential.Eventually I navigated to El Camino Real and from there down to the vicinity of the Stanford campus.I was staying with my friend Brian. Back then he was a Ph.D student at Stanford, but in college we had been roommates. We both came from the midwest and played percussion in some of the university’s various ensembles so we’d grown close. Despite the fact I had spent the four years between college and my stint on his couch hopping between New York, DC, and London in various finance jobs while he headed straight west for his doctoral studies, we were able to pick up more or less where we left off. We played foosball in his living room, obsessed over Farmville (I was interviewing at a couple of mobile gaming companies), and talked about relationships and where our lives were going until the small hours. The normal, somewhat banal mid-20-something navel-gazing.And so moving to the Bay Area in 2011 was easy. Social networking was still novel enough that I could simply search Facebook for people I knew in San Francisco, message them, and get a lot of enthusiastic responses. People weren’t yet jaded about being perpetually online. In fact, that’s how I found my first roommate — a friend of a friend who would go on to co-found Instacart. This was the era of the Facebook Effect, when the larger narrative around these platforms was one of their ability to foster positive change and connect people. The notion that they could channel our cruelest impulses, addict us, and grow into a modern panopticon was not yet what people discussed at dinner parties.The Bay, the epicenter of everything tech, had a special kind of giddy energy. It was far different from the cities I had recently left behind: New York, Washington D.C., and London. San Francisco was friendly, encouraging, “yes and” — seemingly everyone I met earnestly thought they were changing the world for the better. And when they weren’t, they were rock climbing, playing in bands, performing stand-up comedy, making art, dancing on the beach until sunrise, and willing their wildest dreams into existence. The Bay was the home of the Black Panthers, the Hell’s Angels, Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters, The Whole Earth Catalog, and all the descendants of that family tree. You can more or less draw a straight line from the end of World War II through the biker gangs, the hipsters, the civil rights movements, and the hippies straight to Apple Computer, Burning Man, and Google. It wasn’t just that people in the Bay believed they could change the world: they knew they could. All the proof they needed was all around them.Last Thursday I loaded most of my possessions onto a truck. After eleven and a half years, I’m leaving San Francisco — for now.What changed? Is it not still true that the Bay is home to the hackers and misfits who are dreaming up and building a better future?I could cynically weave a narrative about how, in the last decade, the underdogs went mainstream. The pirates became the navy. Startups became The Man. How now every newly-minted MBA rushes out to Silicon Valley with a business plan in hand to build the next “Uber for X” squeezing every last drop of efficiency out of a yet-to-be-digitized industry and that entrepreneurship is just another career ladder. How the real rebels have moved on to weirder pastures and geography is no longer relevant: we all live in the metaverse already, and those who understand that are the ones living in the future, poised to build the next big thing.I could bemoan the sclerotic San Francisco government and its inability to solve basic problems despite vast resources: homelessness, housing costs, property crime, and quality of life concerns. People earnestly debate the role of racial and class equity in preventing public transit fare-jumping, prosecuting individuals shoplifting or selling stolen goods, and open-air drug dealing and consumption. Both sides feel righteous in their anger. The basic social contract is visibly fraying. These things matter.I could note the dissonance between how small teams can build world-changing products and the Bay Area’s collective lack of political will to allow for change. How the region’s politics are dominated by attachment to ideas about the way things should be rather than acceptance of the way things are. How our fixation on aesthetic ideals about how the world should work — from housing to transportation to opening a business — beggars the vast human potential both already living in the Bay Area and that wants to move here. (Despite bad governance, the Bay Area is still growing faster than anywhere else in the country.) How this all amounts to a massive failure of imagination, of aspiration, and of belief in humanity’s potential.Those are all stories I could tell about my relationship to the Bay Area — and none of them are relevant.When I moved here I was 25 years old. I’m now 37.If I was the same person at 37 that I was at 25, I’d be disappointed in myself. I’ve experienced so much and those experiences have changed me.Relationships are the story of overlap. When you meet someone — a friend or a partner — or when you take a job, move to a city, or pick up a hobby, it’s an action that reflects an alignment of circumstances in your life. It’s the right time for that connection to happen. And yet you and whoever (or whatever) you’re in relationship with are both changing all the time in ways both big and small. Those changes accumulate and eventually you might wake up and realize you’re not the same person. That old sweater no longer fits you — maybe not literally, but it no longer feels right. That friendship takes more effort and each time you hang out interactions feel a little more stilted and forced. It’s time to let it go.If you continue to hold onto it there’s a gnawing friction — maybe guilt, maybe grief, maybe just a feeling of nagging discomfort — because you’re out of alignment. You’re acting out of habit. You’re refusing to accept the change that is happening. Change will happen regardless of your attempts to stop or control it. You’re choosing to remain stuck — and choosing not to be open to new things that will enter your life if you let old things go.There is no judgment in changing or letting go. There is no fault or blame. There is no good or bad. It’s just acceptance of what is. It’s the failure to accept change that leads to suffering.Since moving to the Bay I’ve gotten married and divorced. I’ve raised a puppy. I’ve had a half dozen jobs. Friends have come and gone. Some friends have passed before their time, by their own choice or not. Some have had kids. Others have had cancer. A few have had both.I’ve survived a global pandemic. I’ve picked up new hobbies and let others go. My body has transformed: I’ve trained it, injured it, modified it, and healed it.I’ve built and raced several cars, ridden a motorcycle to Burning Man, danced until dawn at underground raves, and sang at the top of my lungs, soaked in sweat seeing my favorite bands perform. I’ve worked out so hard I had trouble stringing together coherent sentences. I’ve made art, played music, watched a meteor shower on a mountaintop with someone I loved, road tripped through the desert, encountered anteaters in the central American jungle, and swam naked in the moonlight in Puerto Rico.I’ve had my heart broken so badly I thought I’d never feel happiness again. I’ve gone to therapy, stopped going to therapy, started going to therapy again, and started doing psychedelic-assisted therapy.All of this has been possible because of the life I created in San Francisco. Had I not moved here over a decade ago many of those things would not have happened. (Naturally, another set of things would have taken their place; yet I do not grieve for not having experienced them.) San Francisco made so much available to me, things that were unique to being here in this decade of my life and at this moment in time, and I gave so much back to it. San Francisco changed my life, and for that I will always be grateful.And yet that does not create an obligation. As my former wife once told me, a relationship is not a death pact. Or, in the words we would both use now: attachment is the root of suffering. Choosing to stay in this city — remaining attached to the life I created here — would be denying change, choosing to foster the conditions for my own unhappiness, creating my own suffering. Living here, in the life I have created with its habits and patterns and quirks and opportunities, is no longer right for who I am. So I am releasing myself from it.I am not blaming the city. I think we do ourselves a disservice by placing agency for our actions outside of ourselves. Our paths converged, intertwined, and are now diverging. It’s okay. Life goes on, just in different directions.Nothing is permanent: those paths might yet intersect later, as Brian and I found out many years ago. By letting go, I am allowing for my own change, growth, and flourishing. Maybe I’ll return, and if I do it will be as a better, more fully-realized version of myself; and it will be because I am once again able to wholeheartedly commit to, celebrate, and contribute to this city’s unique vibrancy. Letting go is sometimes necessary for growth. It is an act of love both for ourselves and for those with whom we are in relation.Sometimes love is not grinding it out, forcing yourself to continue down a specific path, grasping tightly to what you “should” do. Sometimes love is allowing for space so that each of you has room to blossom in the way you need. Sometimes love is thanking your partner and letting go.So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Now it ends as it began: staying at a friend’s place, balanced on that golden thread between what is and what might be, holding it all lightly.----45More from Nicholas MorylFollowI build companies.
