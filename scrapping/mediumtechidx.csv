That is until last year, we reached a tipping point in terms of how heartfelt our conviction was that this would be a better way to live and learn together.‚Äù‚Äî Peter Beck, Head of School at BuxtonStudents at Buxton decorated their Light Phone cases.In the spring of 2022, Peter Beck reached out to Light asking if we had any interest in collaborating with them as they transitioned to a school-wide smartphone ban for students & faculty. We have always wondered what it might look like for a whole school or community to go light collectively, and were quite excited by the idea.Buxton School is located in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts.Coming into the new school year, we shared around 80 phones with everyone learning and working at Buxton. Students set up their Light Phones at orientation and were asked to fill out a short survey about their previous smartphone usage. A week later Peter wrote us:I know our teams are working together to collect more quantitative or detailed info, but I wanted to reach out to you directly about the first week. It‚Äôs incredible. Watching people make new friends, play together outside, say hi to each other as they pass on the path ‚Äî it‚Äôs unreal what a difference this change has made. If what I‚Äôm seeing at Buxton is any indication, I hope more communities adopt light phones or similar technologies en masse. It‚Äôs great to see, and great to be a part of.By mid-October, things still seemed to be going well, and so we planned a trip to interview students and faculty about the experience:Buxton School Goes Light Interview VideoIt‚Äôs one thing when a smartphone user decides to take the plunge and buy themselves a Light Phone, but it‚Äôs much different when it‚Äôs forced upon you by a parent or school. There was some pretty strong pushback from students when the idea was first announced. There was also some friction with the phone itself, with students complaining about the slower speed of texting or lack of particular features. However, it does seem to have had positive benefits all around, especially when talking with teachers about changes in their demeanor and performance. At Buxton, meal time is always communal, and that is one of the places where the positive effects of the smartphone ban are most obvious.Teachers acknowledged that although they are no longer competing with smartphones, students can still struggle with the attention spans required for the school work. This is not an entirely new problem either.While most students told us they intended to return to their smartphones after the Buxton school year, they still acknowledged the benefits of not having smartphones while on campus. Some said they could see themselves using a Light Phone at times for focusing in college, and a few students even seemed keen to keep using a Light Phone as their only phone beyond Buxton.Buxton does not have any plans to bring back smartphones to campus. The conversations that this experiment brings up around smartphones and students is a timely one. It has gathered press coverage (WSJ, November 20) as well as other interested schools reaching out about collaborations.We look forward to sharing more updates on this experience in the future!‚ÄîP.S. If your school or organization is interested in learning more about a potential collaboration ‚Äî please reach out info@thelightphone.com.----5More from The Light PhoneDesigned to be used as little as possible.Read more from The Light PhoneRecommended from MediumEdstutia CommunityVR in Education: Three Ways Virtual Reality Upstages Face-to-Face LearningAppMyHomeLowe‚Äôs Iris Shuts DownNesHere‚Äôs How search result fools you¬†‚Ä¶ü´†Samson DogoUniLend‚Äôs Yield Optimization Platform will be integrated by YOP.AntiquitaWATCH STREAMING > ‚Äú The Magic School Bus Rides Again: The Frizz Connection¬†: Movie 2020 | FULL-HDDustinWarren Buffett has overlooked Tesla‚Äôs Advantages.Zubair TalibTechnologies of the FutureJordan TsanevVirtual vs augmented reality‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall you need to knowAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessLight2.2K Followerswww.thelightphone.comFollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

I still remember the ecstatic feeling and the spirit of enthusiasm bubbling inside me on seeing so many new faces of my seniors, who, I knew, would be playing the guiding light for me in my journey of web development and beyond. A great deal of memories, learning and bonding has only constructed thereafter, over the matter of an year, and let me also take you for a walk through of my journey and experience so far in this amazing club.Setting up the environment | python3 -m envSo the days roll back to the initial times‚Ä¶when I stepped into a premier engineering institute, unaware of the new culture, the new genre of learning that prevails here. Owing to the tedium of online classes, little was I aware of the student activities that this college has fostered through the years and how these very activities shape the student.(actually more than the typical academic curriculum in a college life) Moreover, as every other senior had added the very word ‚Äòexplore‚Äô for (I don‚Äôt know!) countless times, I too set out to roll the wheel in the vast sea of possibilities and turned my leaf to competitive programming at my first shot.But the real awakening arose with the STC intro-talks of the multitude of technical clubs, and they literally spanned almost every imaginable domain I could think of!! No matter what one says, the most popular ones among us newbie freshers remained CP and dev related groups, as clubs like PAG, SDS, IMG, MDG became the talk of the batch.With passing time, these clubs also held lectures on interesting topics of their domains, and I must say, they imparted real boost in getting to know about these domains to a closer extent. But the real test that lay ahead was getting into these clubs.Activating the process | source env/bin/activateNow I had been taking the ongoing activities around me little lightly (JEE break not yet over?), and had missed several intro-talks and lectures too! But soon, discovering that competitive programming seemed to take the better off me in the PAG recruitments, and with no other skill in my hands, I tried to give a shot at web development (after all, I too was desperate to get into a technical club). My mentor, who once had been a part of IMG, was honestly the best person whom I freely approached regarding any guidance, and when the winter projects for IMG recruitments were announced, I wasted no hour and began learning and working on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Now being from an atmosphere where every resource was at my hand‚Äôs disposal, the new way of finding stuffs in real life was simply no less than cracking a hard nut. I must definitely remark upon thing, that if there was one extremely valuable skill that I acquired from my winter project, it was no other than the subtle art of using Google (if you don‚Äôt do webD, trust me, you don‚Äôt know it!üò§).After 2 long months of hardcore coding, I ended up finally submitting a successfully working (and good-looking :D) Typing Speed Game (YAY!!üéä). Although, later I just simply screwed up at IMG‚Äôs recruitment test, I was fortunate enough to be selected for the interviews.Installation (Bingo!) | pip install djangoBefore I get to the serious part(mudde ki baatüòÖ), the coolest stuff I have ever played in my life was the VR Occulus game, that I first ever tried in the lab, while waiting for my interview, and you know, by the time I was done with the game‚Ä¶I had come up with a pretty cool reason in my hands for giving a good interview ahead :P.The technical interview passed an intense 30 minutes, perhaps I was too desperate to not screw up and make it into the club. But it all eased, thanks to the comforting interviewers, who helped with hints, just adequate for me to strike upon with the answers. The HR round went pretty decent too, and I firmly believed that I had not failed to satisfy what they sought inside me.After a day or two, when I received the awaited news, I was confronted with a dilemma, as I had been appearing in other technical clubs‚Äô recruitments too, but I could only be a part of one such club at max. Well, after consulting several opinions, I finally took my shot of faith for IMG, based on the positive suggestions of several people and owing to the wonderful community, the alumni network and the learning environment, and till date, I never ever felt a contrast to what each of them had told me back then.Starting off | python3 manage.py startapp IMGSo came the introductory day, which I described at the beginning, all cheerful faces, of seniors present to induct us into the family and the large space, filled with desktops and the complete IMG people. Lectures began without ado, and the newness of making into this club still seemed to alight me with spirits high. We started receiving assignments, and here, I gotta admit that they seemed so well pretty challenging, but then you gotta know that the wheels start rolling once you don‚Äôt move out of your laptop for hours. All so much of the efforts I had put in making the winter project now seemed to be happening over for each individual assignment. Bugs started taking more time than successful executions and the cool puns in the posters of our lab walls seemed to appear cooler now(iykyk).In a matter of time, all these started becoming an inherent part of this Web Development package and our learning curve, as we slowly progressed from basic HTML, CSS, JS, Git, Linux to Databases, Design, PHP, Django and React. The process seemed so much like a continuum, where countless hours had gone by resolving merely one single issue, apparently wasted, without progress, to the present times with me having so much tech stack at my hands, merely within 8‚Äì9 months. But hold on! If you have created an early impression of IMG based on simply lectures and assignments, then the next section will be bound to topple your opinions upside down(for the good u know).Work Hard‚Ä¶ Party HarderI seriously doubt whether any other club in campus has organized as much grand and lavish chapos as IMG, in the tenure since I have been a part. The freshers, being my first dance chapo in campus itself, was just an absolute blast, following soon by the farewell chapo that was just another in class by itself. What I could not really perceive was how cool this community could be despite the sincerity I have seen in them while in at work. The past months have been so much full of celebrations, be it on account of some alumni visit, or any kind of movie night, the very formal fresher inductionüòù at Solani Walk, the intern chapos and lately being the cool funky Halloween chapo ( I bet no other club in college did this one‚Ä¶YES..NONE DID!!:D). The environment here is so much more than just developing stuff on web, mobile or even games, it‚Äôs more about learning things and enjoying things as they fall on your plate‚Äî the epitome of which reflects in our tagline‚Ä¶‚ÄùWork Hard, But Party Harder!‚ÄùIMG Freshers 2022Role models | import modelsOver the course of months, as I have gotten to know more and more about the community and the alumni history, that has been the club‚Äôs integral part, my dedication to push myself has ever since only fuelled harder. Some of my seniors here have really really mastered their domains and have a rich vibrant treasure of achievements and experiences, that has often inspired me to struggle and strive.People here have been cracking down amazing competitions like GSoC and remarkable internships and placements every year, and many alumni are currently pursuing their careers in top-notch profiled companies as well as prominent universities all around the world. Many of them have carved a distinctive path against the common roadmaps and made their exclusive mark, as they continue to grow ahead in their life. As I say this, the final hours of the farewell chapo make a flashback in my mind, where some of our seniors could be seen with tears and cracked voices in their speech, for they appeared so closely attached with this family that has helped them grow so much and the everlasting bonding they have developed over time.The time since I have been a part of this community has enriched me with so much more than just the skill of WebD. The advices, the togetherness, the bonding I share with IMG at date, is as precious to me than any other aspect of my college life, and I look forward to lay my steps on the footsteps of dedication laid down by our seniors and achieve much more for not only myself but as a whole for the IMG family as well. And last but not the least, this one‚Äôs to my fellow juniors and budding programmers, who too will be gearing up for making it into the various coding clubs‚Ä¶Guys never fall back if ever you find yourself stuck in an endless loop of errors in your codes, coz debugging is what the real learning comes from, and not the successful executions (sad but trueü•≤). And that you will also consistently meet people, who shall be there to pull you out of this loop. So, with my best wishes, keep debugging! Keep rollingü§ò!!Bon Voyage, Amigo!!----More from IMG IIT RoorkeeWe put the technology in the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee.

Is it life? or Creating a character in the video game?I love technical innovations and I often feel fascinated, when I understand an innovation or idea. I had mixed feelings when I heard about Neuralink for the first time. I discussed it in my blog related to Neuralink.For the first time, I felt terrified by watching this Ectolife concept. Hashem Al-Ghaili is the man behind this concept.As explained in the video, this concept can solve the problems of Surrogacy and infertility issues. Yes, it might sound great for those, who faced those issues but I believe that there will be a lot of differences between machine-reproduced babies and human-reproduced babies.The reproduction system is a part of living things‚Äô lifecycle. When speaking particularly about humans, few of them might face problems related to the reproduction system, whereas others might face issues with different organs in the body (which is quite common and acceptable) because, as far as I know, there isn‚Äôt a perfect human being exist till date (with not even a small problem related to health in his/her lifetime).The entire concept is a concern for me, but in specific, I would discuss a couple of aspects, in which I am more concerned.Every growth pod features sensors that can monitor the baby‚Äôs vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, breathing rate, and oxygen saturationEctolife growth pod features internal speakersConcern: What about the RADIATION effect? most of the sensors cause at least a slight effect of radiation. Wouldn‚Äôt there be any effect of SOUND WAVES and ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES (which are responsible for sound waves)?Genetically engineering the embryo before implanting it into artificial wombs?Concern: This is the biggest concern I have. I believe every one of us is unique in this world because of our genes, which are inherited from our ancestors. Now, if we have the power of altering the genes of a person‚Ää‚Äî‚Äächoosing the height, weight, physical structure, skin tone, etc. Are we creating a character in a video game?‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf everyone alters their genes and can become strongest and fair, then isn‚Äôt it a cause for war to kill others to survive in the competition and only one exists (to become unique)?I don‚Äôt back Ectolife at any cost, even if there are a couple of positive aspects like fixing inherited genetic diseases and as an alternative for couples with infertility issues. I can‚Äôt imagine a world where Ectolife and Neuralink combine with no regulation exists around. It becomes a disastrous world to live in and I wouldn‚Äôt wish to be in such a place, where these two concepts become reality and function as they want.----6More from Innovations in Technology and HealthcareThis publication aims to present you with the most recent and noteworthy innovations and research, which have the power to disrupt the future.Read more from Innovations in Technology and HealthcareRecommended from MediumAmyA quiet corner for the Highly Sensitive ChildDeborah KristinainThe Post-Grad Survival GuideMy Letter to ‚ÄòTiger Mom‚Äô Writer, Amy ChuaWarisara NgansathilChildren behavior is shaped by surroundingTeresa NicoleSuper Secret dmirerMercy Beyond BordersMeet Baby RuthSignOff TogetherinSignOffTogetherCutting the Cord:Dave SmithDads‚Äô Survival Guide for Shelter-in-Place: Step 1Heal with SumitinILLUMINATION3 Golden Rules of Parenting That You Must KnowAboutHelpTermsPrivacyGet the Medium appGet unlimited accessChamanth mvs61 FollowersData Science and ML practitioner | Blogging on medium on technology and self-thoughts | https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamanth-mvs-9a59a4131/FollowHelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
