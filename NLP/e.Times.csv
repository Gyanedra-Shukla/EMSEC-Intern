Low vitamin D level in the body and obesity: Is there a link?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-1114286,msid-96131966,width-600,resizemode-4/96131966.jpg","Several research studies have found that overweight people have lower vitamin D levels in the body. Studies have concluded that body mass index has a direct link with the amount of vitamin D present in the body.
These people are said to be less able to convert vitamin D into its active form.
Ideally, one should have 50 nmol/L or above for the overall health of bone. Several health experts say that the ideal amount of vitamin D in the body should never be below 50nmol/L and not more than 125 nmol/L.""Obesity-associated vitamin D insufficiency is likely due to the decreased bioavailability of vitamin D3 from cutaneous and dietary sources because of its deposition in body fat compartments,"" 2003 study had found.
Studies say there is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in people who are obese maybe due to volumetric dilution of vitamin D. This is so far the ""the most probable mechanism of the inverse relationship between vitamin D serum levels and BMI.""Since vitamin D is clearly associated with weight, higher levels of it can actually help in weight loss.
Vitamin D has an impact on the storage of fats and the production of fat cells in the body as a result of which it is linked to weight loss. Another explanation is that being a hormone, it prompts neurotransmitters linked to body fat and serotonin. Studies have found that higher levels of vitamin D increases the levels of testosterone and serotonin in the body.Vitamin D has several benefits over the human body.
It helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body.
It is vital for the strength of bones, teeth and muscles. Lack of this vitamin leads to bone deformities like rickets in kids and osteomalacia in adults.
Several studies have shown that vitamin D reduces cancer growth
It also controls infections and reduces inflammation
It improves mood and reduces depression
It has a role in reducing heart diseasesThe common signs of vitamin D deficiency which demand immediate attention of a physician include: tiredness, body ache, pin, muscle pain and weakness, stress fractures in legs, pelvis, and hips.
Some people might also experience loss of appetite, getting sick more often, hair loss, sleeplessness, fatigue and depression due to lack of vitamin D.While it is first advised to get vitamin D from sunlight, in view of unavoidable circumstances like location supplements are recommended.
But one should not blindly self-administer the supplements. One should contact a physician and get the right doses of vitamin D supplements in order to avoid getting an overdose.Vitamin D overdose can be harmful to the body. Also known as vitamin D toxicity, this is a serious medical condition.
Due to overdose of vitamin D there is a toxic build up of calcium in the blood.
Vitamin D toxicity is characterized by nausea, vomiting, weakness, and frequent urination. It might also cause bone pain and kidney problems. ""Excessive sun exposure does not cause vitamin D toxicity due to the regulation and conversion of Vitamin D to its inactive metabolites,"" says a study.
This toxicity is commonly seen in patients who need high doses of vitamin D for diseases like osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, psoriasis, gastric bypass surgery, celiac, or inflammatory bowel disease."
"COVID or not, keeping these household items clean can cut down various infection risks","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-1186370,msid-96129932,width-600,resizemode-4/96129932.jpg","Two years after the pandemic was declared, many of us have been dreaded so much that we can’t think of leaving home without sanitizing our hands and wearing masks.
Back in those days where we had not learned about pandemic, we never thought of contracting a virus from a crowd. Stepping into a crowded place did not bother us. But post-pandemic, things have changed. Everytime we think of a crowded place the scary thoughts of people in hospitals, and lockdowns disturb us.
While COVID has definitely taught us several things, one thing that can hold relevance till the infinite future is keeping commonly used household items clean.You were doing it earlier but might have stopped doing it just as COVID cases fell.
Door handles are accessible to adults mostly. From people living inside to outsiders like delivery people almost everyone automatically tries to turn on the door handle.
Given the obvious fact that people rarely use hand sanitizers or gloves these days, you need to disinfect the door handle frequently now.Now that the door handle is clean and hygienic you need to keep the edges of the door clean as well.
If you have kids, you should be aware that they drag and open a door holding the lower edge.
Also, you might have the habit of leaning on the door edge with your cheek pushed in or head resting on it, while talking to neighbors.
This makes door handles another potential breeding place for the pathogens. Disinfect it too.Nobody in the house is restricted to using TV and AC remotes. Sometimes we quickly change the channel with our sticky fingers and do not bother to clean it later, sometimes we simply come from outside and crash on the couch and start pressing channel numbers.
TV remotes are one of the most frequently used objects which need to be cleaned regularly.Cleaning the toys of kids should be a regular habit as kids tend to put everything into their mouth.
Just as you do the laundry of your kids' clothes with utmost sincerity and care you need to do the same with the toys as well.There is no entry restriction to a switch board. Barring the younger kids, adults use it mostly in households.
While pressing a switch we never think about risking our health from pathogens. This spontaneous action can trouble us with infections. Try to keep your switch board clean regularly. Use dry clothes to swipe it clean, avoid using damp or moist clothes over switch boards.If you have your shoe rack inside your room, you need to put it outside right now. Especially when there are babies and toddlers in the house, it is safer to keep the shoe racks outside.
Shoes come directly in contact with the contaminants which are spread everywhere on the road in the form of sputum, spits and what not.
It is advisable to keep shoes outside the house.
Do we need a health check-up before signing for a gym membership?"
Do we need a health check-up before signing for a gym membership?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-1285219,msid-96125459,width-600,resizemode-4/96125459.jpg","As more incidences of heart attacks in gyms and from visibly fit people are coming forward, many have started questioning the way we are working out. Can you just sign up for a gym membership and start doing heavy exercises? Or is it necessary to have a health check up before undertaking a gym activity?
Before going deeper into this, we need to understand that working out has several dimensions and not just weight loss. While it is commonly associated with decrease in weight, workouts have several benefits on the human body.On whether one should get a health check up done before joining gym, Dr.Rajiv Dang, Senior Director and HOD - Internal Medicine and Medical Director, Max Hospital Gurugram says, ""The need for this comes up when someone is trying to go to an extreme form of exercising schedule including gyming and plans to take drugs or supplements which are now a days a fab to build up muscles. Those are the situations where we must know where the body is and what additions it may or may not be able to handle.""""This I say because I have seen young boys taking these products and coming to the hospital with renal dysfunction etc.,"" Dr Dang adds.
In the same line, Dr. Brahm Datt Pathak, Director, General Surgery, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad says definitely health check-up will inform us about the basic internal milieu of the body, guide us regarding the type and severity of exercise to be avoided or intensified as per the need of the person.""If tests have to be done, then looking at a good cardiac and pulmonary profile including your vitals pulse, blood pressure, SPO2, blood sugar and components of other body parts like CBC, renal function and liver function can be carried out,"" says Dr Dang.
Giving more insights on the type of tests one needs to do before joining gym, Dr Viral Patel, Consultant Internal Medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad says, ""we should go for basic blood investigations like Haemoglobin, lipid profile, thyroid profile, ECG, and 2D ECHO.""Dr Patel goes on and adds that, ""if a person has backache or any spine-related issues they must get a screening done so that the instructor is aware of the condition and trains the person accordingly. One should let the gym instructor know about their medical conditions and whether or not they are taking medications for it.""
""Some further tests may be required depending on your medical history,"" adds Dr Dang.""No, working out is not only about weight loss. It is to keep the muscles and the basic torso of the body in the best possible shape and also to keep different organs like cardiac and pulmonary to be primed to be in a position to undergo the stress which may be required on an SOS basis,"" explains Dr Dang.
Dr Patel's view on this is quite similar too. ""No, it's an added benefit. Doing any kind of exercise improves our cardiac and respiratory functions. It also improves our emotional ability, hormonal imbalances and sarcopenia (decrease in muscle mass). It helps improve age-related changes,"" says Dr Patel.
Workout is more about cardio- respiratory fitness , muscle toning, agility , strength , vigor , positive attitude and psychological equanimity, says Dr Pathak.Skipping warm up and rest days is extremely lethal for the body. As much as it is important to work out, it is important to prepare the body and give it a good rest before and after a good workout.
Another bad habit is performing excessive amounts of endurance exercises ignoring your ability and of course medical condition. You need to be mindful of your limitations.
Following a trend blindly might not give you the same benefit. You need to find a workout customized for you."
Should you fast before having a blood test?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-1114060,msid-96105770,width-600,resizemode-4/96105770.jpg","We undergo several blood tests in a year. Since the blood reports are the most accurate way to determine the biological well being of a person, we should know a thing or two about the do’s and don’ts of blood tests.
""When you are preparing for any health check-up, your focus is mainly on silent diseases,"" says Dr Shashikant Nigam, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad emphasizing on the growing incidences of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and other chronic illnesses.
Adding more information to this and segregating the nature of the tests, Dr Anubhav Pandey, Head, Clinical Labs, Department of Microbiology, Amrita Hospital, Faridabad says though fasting is essential for many blood tests, it solely depends on what kind of test you will have. ""The prerequisite for every test is unique and it entirely depends on the type of blood tests being performed. For example, to test the fasting blood Glucose and liver function, the sample must be given in a fasting state,"" he says.The experts say anywhere between 8-12 hours of fasting is good enough. For Glucose, 10-12 hours of fasting, and 12-14 hours, for Lipid profile (Cholesterol) are required, says Dr Nigam.
Emphasizing more on the importance of the fasting period, Dr Pandey recommends: If there is any fatty meal in the preceding 8-12 hours, it is recommended to get tested on another day.""When there is intake of food in the preceding 8-12 hours, there are certain biochemical processes which are underway and leads to false interpretation of their levels in blood. Analytes such as Triglycerides and LDL Cholesterol may be elevated after a high-fat meal in the preceding 72 hours of sample collection and might lead to clinical misinterpretation,"" explains Dr Pandey.
""During endoscopy if the patient is not fasting, there may be food particles that occlude clear view of stomach and esophagus,"" explains Dr Gude and adds that in such cases aberrant or false readings will be reported.No, you cannot.
""Food items taken with or without milk will alter the level of glucose and lipids because Serum (supernatant fluid obtained from blood after centrifuge), which is used for estimation, becomes cloudy, and we will end up getting wrong reports. Hence fasting is mandatory,"" explains Dr Nigam.
On this, Dr Pandey explains about diuresis or excessive urine. He says, ""diuresis after consumption of Coffee and tea may lead to dehydration and multiple attempts may be needed to find a suitable vein, making the process of blood collection painful.""Yes, say the experts.
Water does not interfere with the quality of serum for these tests, says Dr Pandey.""Usually about 6 and half to 7 hours of sleep is recommended. Heightened anxiety,insomnia, having alcohol the previous night, smoking, chewing gum, strenuous exercise before blood tests etc should be avoided as the readings may be falsely elevated or decreased,"" says Dr Gude.
""Certain tests like cortisol levels might get elevated due to stress and lack of sleep,"" says Dr Pandey.
Dr Nigam says insufficient sleep can alter the reports of diabetic patients. ""Quantity of sleep can sometimes give altered reports in the case of diabetic patients who are on regular treatment,"" he says and recommends proper sleep before blood test.No.
It is not necessary at all, as blood reports are not affected by empty bowels but are directly related to an empty stomach.
“Most doctors do not tell diabetics that their sugar can drop and it can be dangerous”"
"As Japanese encephalitis cases reported in country, key symptoms to know","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-1021745,msid-96106220,width-600,resizemode-4/96106220.jpg","Japanese encephalitis is an infection caused by Japanese encephalitis virus, related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses.
This virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex species mosquitoes, and mostly Culex tritaeniorhynchus.
As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), 24 countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions have Japanese encephalitis virus transmission risk, which includes more than 3 billion people.Recently Pune recorded the first case of Japanese encephalitis for the first time in three years. The patient, a 4 year old boy, was on ventilator support for nine days and was in the ICU for 15 days after his admission.
The boy was admitted to a city hospital on November 3.
21 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been found in Karnataka.The boy reported symptoms like fever, headache, weakness and seizures.
His blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were sent to National Institute of Virology which were confirmed to have Japanese encephalitis virus.The infection usually has mild symptoms which are in the form of fever and headache.
1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. Severe illness is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death.
The incubation period for Japanese encephalitis virus is 4-14 days.Health experts have said that of those who survive COVID, 20%–30% suffer permanent neurologic issues.
""Of those who survive, 20%–30% suffer permanent intellectual, behavioural or neurological sequelae such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak,"" says the WHO.While the Japanese encephalitis vaccine drive has begun in Karnataka for 48 lakh children, it is yet to begin in full swing at other places.
Currently, Jenvac is being administered to kids free of cost in 10 districts of Karnataka. The drive is expected to conclude within 3 weeks.
JENVAC is a single dose vaccine prepared from an Indian strain (Kolar- 821564XY) of the Japanese encephalitis virus. It is administered intramuscularly.
As per reports a total of 68,000 such cases are reported in the country every year."
"Coronavirus: Nearly half of COVID patients globally have symptoms even after 4 months, new study finds","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-38630,msid-96106120,width-600,resizemode-4/96106120.jpg","A giant new research analyzing nearly 200 studies of prior COVID patients globally has found that almost half of COVID survivors—both children and adults—continue to experience lingering symptoms even four months after their initial infection.
This analysis by researchers at the University of Leicester in England involved nearly 750,000 people in all. Some of these patients were hospitalized from a severe COVID infection, and some weren’t.More than 45% of the study participants had at least one lingering symptom. A quarter of the COVID patients reported fatigue, and a similar number said they felt pain or discomfort. Other reported symptoms that lasted even for four months include sleep issues, breathlessness, and problems participating in daily activities.Long COVID happens when COVID symptoms persist long after the initial infection is gone.
Many experts say that long COVID is best defined as a condition like chronic fatigue syndrome, that develops after COVID illness. This is similar to other post-viral syndromes that may occur after infection with herpes, Lyme disease, and Ebola.
Post-COVID complications such as organ damage should not be defined as long COVID, experts say.

However, no clinical abnormalities could be found to explain the long COVID symptoms for certain.
“The reasons as to why so many patients are experiencing long COVID remains unknown,” the authors wrote. Possible causes for lingering symptoms even after the initial infection is gone include organ damage, inflammation, altered immune systems, and psychological effects.Some studies have found a higher rate of long COVID in females, however, this study didn’t find that any particular age group, gender or race experienced higher rates of the disabling condition. Only a quarter of studies examined provided participants’ race or ethnicity.
Read more: “Most doctors do not tell diabetics that their sugar can drop and it can be dangerous”The researchers note that “harmonization of data collection tools will be fundamental to improving the clinical utility of findings from systematic reviews of Long COVID.”
Given the high prevalence of lingering COVID symptoms after 12 weeks (nearly 1 in 2 people), healthcare services and policy need to prioritize Long COVID care, they add."
